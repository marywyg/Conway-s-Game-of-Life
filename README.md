# Conway's Game of Life
A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in Java. There is no graphic interface (WIP), everything is shown in the console.

This project is currently being developed as part of "Java in the Internet and Mobile Devices" course on my 5th semester of Informatics studies.

### How to use
The navigation in menus is handled by entering intigers representing the user's choices. Entering an incorrect input will result in an error message. 
The game is initialized with a blank grid, so before starting game please choose one of the patterns by selecting the "Change parameters" along with "Change initial cells". Due to the current simplicity and console limitations, only specific cell patterns can be selected, but creating own patterns will be implemented in the future.
